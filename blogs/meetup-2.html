	NetflixOSS Meetup - Season 1, Episode 2
</h1>

<p>
	The second NetflixOSS Meetup.  Stay up to date with the latest projects, and be the first to hear exciting announcements!
	See the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Netflix-Open-Source-Platform/events/102517072/">meetup page</a> for complete details.
</p>

<p>
	Netflix has Open Sourced many components of our infrastructure over the last year - ranging from our deployment console Asgard and 
	Simian Army Monkeys, to the Cassandra and Zookeeper clients that we use internally.  You can find all of our Open Source projects at 
	<a href="http://netflix.github.com">our Github site</a>.
</p>

<p>
	The components can be used separately, but we use them as an integrated platform to support the Netflix web site and services. 
	We have several missing pieces that we plan to release over the coming months that will fill out the platform functionality.
</p>

<p>
	So far we’ve had great interest and involvement from the open source community, and would like to extend an invitation to our 
	NetflixOSS Meetup.  At this event you can meet the authors of the components and deep-dive into technology and architectural choices.  
	We’ll show how all the components fit together, and share some details on what’s coming next on our Open Source Platform roadmap.
